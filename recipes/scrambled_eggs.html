    <h3>Perfect Scrambled Eggs</h3>
    <p>You might be thinking, <em>"who needs a recipe for a scrambled egg?</em> Well, <strong>YOU!</strong> (and me, of course!)</p> 
    <p>I promise you this simple and easy recipe will be the best scrambled eggs you've had since your mama made it for you!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>2tbs unstalted butter</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk together until very well combined. Add salt and pepper. (Start with about 1/4 teaspoon salt.)</li>
        <li>Put a medium-sized nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Swirl the butter around until melted completely, then reduce the heat to medium low. Add the eggs. Use a spatula to stir the eggs around the pan. It may take a few minutes before the eggs start to form curds. Use the spatula to push and fold the eggs over on themselves, being sure to push the liquidy parts of the egg to make contact with the skillet. Stir frequently. Once the eggs are mainly set but still wet, remove the pan from the heat. Then continue to stir until they are done to your liking*. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your perfect scrambled eggs!</p>
